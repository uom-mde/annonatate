Perhaps the ambiguity noted by Kraus (2004, 201), referring to the actually extant bronze heads, is true for some elements of this drawing as well. \n\n\"One of the heads, a tiger, looks remarkably like a bear. The bear is not in the Chinese zodiac and one imagines that Castiglione had little experience with tigers as he was completing the fountain\".",
